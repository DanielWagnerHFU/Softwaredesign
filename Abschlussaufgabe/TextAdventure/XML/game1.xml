And then, some people consider aesthetics the enemy of the pragmatic: ‘don’t spend time writing beautiful code when you can write effective code’. However, I argue that my sense of beauty serves pragmatism much better, because it leads to more concise and maintainable code, and is thereby far more effective.”[Ruben Verborgh]">

Programming is about automating work like crunching data, processing and presenting information, or controlling and automating machines. Non-programmers don’t care about the aesthetics of software in the same way non-plumbers don’t care about the aesthetics of plumbing – they just want their information in the right place or their hot water to work.

Of course it is there to engender a sense of majesty and wonder, and cause us to engage the part of ourselves that appreciates beauty and magnificence […]. What makes it a craft is the work above and beyond its basic utility to give it intrinsic, aesthetic beauty.” ">

In the latter case the last thing I want is someone’s ‘personality’ causing some of the blocks to be different sizes and no longer interchangeable, never mind the added expense of having someone manually hew the stone rather than using machine tools. In the former the stonemason’s attitude is indulgent. He is putting his signature (and his ego, and his reputation) into this magnificent representation of Hell’s best. If you just wanted an oil-pouring spout you could get one from a DIY store. Software practitioners – especially, ironically, the good ones – often lose sight of this. They fall in love with the software itself and start thinking of themselves as craftsmen of software.” "></DialogNode>
